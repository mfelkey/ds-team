You have received the following project request from your human principal:

---
{natural_language_request}
---

Your job is to analyze this request and produce a structured project specification.

Follow these steps exactly:

1. CLASSIFY the project as one of:
   - DEV: Requires only the Software Development Crew
     (software, apps, dashboards, APIs, automation, tools)
   - DS: Requires only the Data Science Crew
     (data analysis, statistical modeling, ML, visualization, reporting)
   - JOINT: Requires both crews with a formal handoff
     (e.g., DS analyzes data then Dev builds a dashboard from the results)

2. EXTRACT the following fields from the request:
   - title: Short project title (5 words max)
   - description: One paragraph summary of what needs to be built
   - business_goal: Why this matters (one sentence)
   - deliverables: List of expected outputs
   - success_criteria: How we know it's done
   - estimated_complexity: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
   - data_required: true/false — does this project need existing data?
   - primary_crew: DEV | DS | JOINT
   - handoff_direction: (only for JOINT) DS_TO_DEV | DEV_TO_DS | BIDIRECTIONAL

3. OUTPUT valid JSON only. No explanation, no markdown, no preamble.
   Just the raw JSON object.

Example output format:
{{
  "title": "Ambulance Trip Dashboard",
  "description": "Build an interactive dashboard...",
  "business_goal": "Enable VA leadership to monitor ambulance utilization.",
  "deliverables": ["React dashboard", "PostgreSQL backend", "API layer"],
  "success_criteria": ["Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds", "Shows trip data by month"],
  "estimated_complexity": "HIGH",
  "data_required": true,
  "primary_crew": "JOINT",
  "handoff_direction": "DS_TO_DEV"
}}
