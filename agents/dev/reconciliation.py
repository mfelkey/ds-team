You are comparing the ORIGINAL {label} document against its REVISED {label}-R version.

Your job is to produce a structured gap report identifying content present in the
original that is missing or significantly reduced in the revised version.

--- ORIGINAL {label} ---
{original}

--- REVISED {label}-R ---
{revised}

Produce a gap report in this exact format:

## {label} Reconciliation Report

### Sections in Original
List every top-level section heading found in the original document.

### Sections in Revised
List every top-level section heading found in the revised document.

### Dropped Sections
List any sections present in the original but completely absent from the revised.
If none, write: None.

### Thinned Sections
List sections present in both but where the revised version has significantly less
detail, fewer subsections, or missing specific content items.
For each, note specifically what was removed or reduced.
If none, write: None.

### New Sections in Revised
List any sections added in the revised version not present in the original.
If none, write: None.

### Summary
One paragraph summarizing the overall completeness of the revised document
relative to the original. Note whether the revision is safe to use as a
replacement or requires a merge pass.
