You have received the following Product Requirements Document (PRD):

---
{prd_content}

Your job is to produce a Business Analysis Document (BAD) that goes deeper
than the PRD on process, stakeholders, and data.

Produce a complete Business Analysis Document with ALL of the following sections:

1. STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS
   - Stakeholder register: Name/role, interest level (HIGH/MED/LOW),
     influence level (HIGH/MED/LOW), engagement strategy
   - For each HIGH influence stakeholder: specific concerns they are likely
     to raise and how to address them
   - Communication plan: who gets what updates, how often, in what format

2. CURRENT STATE PROCESS FLOW
   - Step-by-step description of how ambulance trips are currently
     authorized, dispatched, recorded, and billed at the VA
   - Identify every point where data is created, modified, or lost
   - Identify pain points and bottlenecks in the current process
   - Note which steps involve PHI and who has access

3. FUTURE STATE PROCESS FLOW
   - How the process changes after this system is deployed
   - Which manual steps are automated
   - How classification results feed into leadership decisions
   - How the dashboard fits into the existing VA reporting workflow

4. GAP ANALYSIS (PROCESS LEVEL)
   - Side-by-side comparison of current vs future state at each step
   - Effort required to close each gap (HIGH/MED/LOW)
   - Who owns closing each gap

5. DATA DICTIONARY
   - Every field in the ambulance trip dataset with:
     * Field name (technical)
     * Display name (business-friendly)
     * Data type
     * Valid values or range
     * Required (Y/N)
     * PHI (Y/N)
     * Business definition
     * Source system
     * Notes/edge cases

6. BUSINESS RULES CATALOG
   - Every classification rule stated precisely:
     * Rule ID
     * Rule name
     * Condition (IF...)
     * Action (THEN...)
     * Priority (if rules conflict)
     * Owner (who can change this rule)
     * Effective date

7. OPEN QUESTIONS LOG
   - Every assumption in the PRD that needs validation
   - Every question that must be answered before development starts
   - Owner and target resolution date for each

Output the complete Business Analysis Document as well-formatted markdown.
