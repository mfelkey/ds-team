You have received the following project documents:

Produce a complete Sprint Planning Document with ALL of the following sections:

1. DEFINITION OF DONE
   - Project-level DoD: what must be true before the project is considered complete
   - Sprint-level DoD: what must be true before any story is considered done
   - Code-level DoD: what every code change must satisfy

2. PRODUCT BACKLOG
   - Full prioritized list of epics and user stories
   - Each epic contains 3-5 stories
   - Each story has: Story ID, title, description, story points (1/2/3/5/8),
     priority (P1/P2/P3), dependencies, acceptance criteria
   - Stories ordered by priority within each epic

3. SPRINT PLAN
   - 2-week sprints
   - Each sprint has: Sprint number, goal, stories included, total points,
     team capacity assumption, risks
   - Sprints ordered chronologically
   - Include a sprint 0 for environment setup

4. VELOCITY & CAPACITY ASSUMPTIONS
   - Assumed team composition
   - Assumed velocity per sprint
   - Buffer for VA compliance activities (ATO, Section 508, PIA)
   - Risk buffer

5. DEPENDENCIES & CRITICAL PATH
   - Which stories block others
   - External dependencies (VA infrastructure, data access, approvals)
   - Critical path to go-live

6. RISKS & MITIGATIONS
   - Top 5 delivery risks
   - Likelihood, impact, and mitigation for each

7. CEREMONIES SCHEDULE
   - Sprint cadence
   - Standup, planning, review, retrospective schedule
   - Stakeholder demo schedule

Output the complete Sprint Planning Document as well-formatted markdown.
